## About the webpage: 
- This webpage is built using semantic HTML, which means that each tag is chosen for its meaning and role on the page. The content is organized using semantic tags like header, main, section, article, aside, and footer, which help to convey the structure and purpose of the page to both humans and machines.

- Within the content, you'll find a variety of basic HTML elements like p for paragraphs, a for links, div for containers, and img for images. These elements are used to create a simple but effective layout that is easy to read and navigate.

 - To ensure that the page is accessible on all devices, media queries have been used to adjust the layout and styling based on screen size. This means that the page is responsive to all screens, from mobile devices to desktops.

 - In addition to the HTML and media queries, the page also includes some basic CSS styles to add color and formatting. However, the focus is on the HTML and the use of semantic tags to create a well-structured, accessible webpage.

 - Overall, this page demonstrates the importance of using semantic HTML, basic elements, and media queries to create clear, effective, and responsive web content.
